# Accounting Groups and Ledgers in R

This document explains the hierarchy of accounting groups, ledgers, and basic ledger operations (creation, addition, alteration, deletion) with plain R code examples, suitable for understanding and educational purposes.

## Group of Accounts

A group of accounts refers to a collection of ledgers that share similar characteristics. Groups help organize financial data systematically.

group_of_accounts <- list(
Assets = c("Cash", "Bank", "Accounts Receivable"),
Liabilities = c("Loans", "Creditors"),
Income = c("Sales", "Interest Received"),
Expenses = c("Salaries", "Rent")
)
print(group_of_accounts)

text

## Pre-defined Group

Pre-defined groups are standard categories used in accounting software or systems (like Tally). These include Assets, Liabilities, Income, and Expenses.

predefined_groups <- c("Assets", "Liabilities", "Income", "Expenses")
print(predefined_groups)

text

## Primary Group and Sub-Group

- **Primary Group:** Top-level categories (such as Assets, Expenses).
- **Sub-Group:** Sub-divisions within a primary group (e.g., 'Current Assets', 'Direct Expenses').

groups <- list(
Assets = list("Current Assets" = c("Cash", "Bank"), "Fixed Assets" = c("Equipment", "Real Estate")),
Expenses = list("Direct Expenses" = c("Raw Materials"), "Indirect Expenses" = c("Rent", "Utilities"))
)
print(groups)

text

## Ledger

A ledger is an individual account within a group, representing a specific item (e.g., Cash account under Assets). Each ledger records all transactions related to that item.

ledger_cash <- list(name = "Cash", group = "Current Assets", balance = 15000)
print(ledger_cash)

text

## Creation of Ledgers

### Single Ledger Creation

Create a single ledger by specifying its name, group, and opening balance.

create_ledger <- function(name, group, balance) {
list(name = name, group = group, balance = balance)
}
ledger_salary <- create_ledger("Salary", "Indirect Expenses", 0)
print(ledger_salary)

text

### Multiple Ledger Creation

Create multiple ledgers by supplying vectors of names, groups, and balances.

ledger_names <- c("Sales", "Purchases", "Bank")
ledger_groups <- c("Income", "Expenses", "Current Assets")
ledger_balances <- c(50000, 30000, 15000)
ledgers <- mapply(create_ledger, ledger_names, ledger_groups, ledger_balances, SIMPLIFY = FALSE)
print(ledgers)

text

## Addition, Alteration, and Deletion of Ledgers

### Addition

Add a new ledger to the existing list.

add_ledger <- function(ledgers, new_ledger) {
c(ledgers, list(new_ledger))
}
new_ledger <- create_ledger("Rent", "Indirect Expenses", 0)
ledgers <- add_ledger(ledgers, new_ledger)
print(ledgers)

text

### Alteration

Modify ledger properties (e.g., update balance).

alter_ledger <- function(ledger, new_balance) {
ledger$balance <- new_balance
ledger
}
ledgers[] <- alter_ledger(ledgers[], 60000)
print(ledgers)

text

### Deletion

Remove a ledger by its name.

delete_ledger <- function(ledgers, name) {
ledgers[!sapply(ledgers, function(x) x$name == name)]
}
ledgers <- delete_ledger(ledgers, "Bank")
print(ledgers)

> **Summary:**  
> Groups and ledgers form the backbone of accounting data organization. R can be used to illustrate basic operations with functions for creation, addition, alteration, and deletion, from single to multiple ledger entries.
